# üöÄ E-Commerce Microservices Backend: Scalable, Event-Driven Architecture

#### This project implements a backend system for an e-commerce platform utilizing a microservices architecture with graphql-gateway being single point of entry. While developing this project i focused on building a scalable, event-driven architecture that can handle high traffic and provide real-time updates. The system is designed to be modular, allowing for easy addition of new features and services.

## ‚ú® Why This Architecture Stands Out

### üß© Independent & Scalable Services

Each core domain (Users, Products, Orders) operates as a standalone service with dedicated databases. Scale individual components independently to meet demand spikes without over-provisioning resources.

### ‚ö° Real-Time Event-Driven Communication

Services communicate asynchronously via **Apache Kafka**, ensuring loose coupling and fault tolerance. Key events (new orders, inventory updates) trigger real-time reactions across the system while **Dead Letter Queues** handle failures gracefully.

### üîç Unified Data Access with GraphQL

Clients interact through a single **GraphQL Gateway** that aggregates data from multiple services, reducing roundtrips and enabling tailored responses. Redis caching slashes response times for frequent queries.

### üîí Zero-Trust Security Model

JWT-based authentication secures every API call. Tokens issued by the User Service are validated at the gateway, ensuring only authorized requests reach downstream services.

### üìä Observability First

Monitor every heartbeat of the system with **Prometheus metrics** and **Grafana dashboards**. Track API latency, Kafka consumer lag, cache hit ratios, and more in real time.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

![E-Commerce Microservices Architecture Diagram](archDiagram2.png)

### Core Components Flow

1. **Client Requests** hit the GraphQL Gateway (4000) for unified access.
2. **Synchronous Calls**: Gateway uses Axios to fetch user/product/order data directly.
3. **Asynchronous Events**: Services emit Kafka events for cross-domain actions:
   - Order Service ‚Üí `order-events` ‚Üí Inventory updates & recommendations.
   - Product Service ‚Üí `promotional-events` ‚Üí Targeted email campaigns.
4. **Redis Cache**: Strategically placed in Gateway, Product, and Recommendation services for instant data access.
5. **Monitoring**: All services expose Prometheus metrics, visualized in Grafana.

## üö¶ Running Locally in 5 minutes

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js v18+

### Launch using Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ecommerce-microservices.git
cd ecommerce-microservices

# Spin up all services with metrics & monitoring
docker-compose up --build
```

**Access Endpoints:**

## üåü Key Features Breakdown

### 1. Intelligent Product Recommendations

- **Rule Engine**: Analyzes purchase history (stored in Redis) to suggest complementary products.
- **Event-Driven Updates**: New orders trigger real-time recommendation recalculations.
- **Cached Results**: Users get instant suggestions from Redis, reducing load on the Recommendation Service.

### 2. Priority Notification System

- **Critical Alerts**: Order confirmations, password resets (High Priority Queue).
- **Promotional Emails**: Newsletters, sales (Standard Queue with rate limiting).
- **Automatic Retries**: Failed emails land in Kafka DLQ for later processing.

## üìö Documentation & Resources

- **API Reference**: `/docs` endpoint in each service (Swagger UI)
- **Postman Collection**: `E-Commerce Microservices.postman_collection.json`
