  "description": "This project is a **scalable, event-driven microservices-based backend** designed to support the complex operations of an e-commerce platform. It consists of multiple independent services, each with its own database, connected asynchronously through **Kafka** and exposing APIs via **GraphQL**. The system is built with a strong focus on **performance, reliability, and scalability**, featuring **Redis caching**, **JWT authentication**, **priority-based notification handling**, and **observability** through monitoring tools like **Prometheus and Grafana**. The containerized architecture ensures seamless deployment and management.",
